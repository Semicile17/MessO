# MessO - Online Mess-Off Management System for GBPIET Hostels

MessO is an online platform designed to simplify the mess-off management system for hostels at GBPIET. It enables students to apply for mess-off periods when they are not present in the hostel, reducing the administrative burden 
on the management and improving efficiency.

## Features

- **Admin Approval System**: Wardens, caretakers, and admins can review and approve/reject mess-off requests.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure access for different roles like `warden`, `caretaker`, and `devs`, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access student data and approve requests.
- **Automated Notifications**: Students receive notifications when their mess-off requests are approved or rejected.
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Responsive design that allows students to access the system via mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Admins can track the status of requests in real time.
